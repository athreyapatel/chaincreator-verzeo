                             In 1965, the Nebraska Legislature created the Educational Service Unit system to provide supplemental services to school districts. ESUs are service-oriented, non-regulatory agencies designed to achieve a better balance of educational opportunities for students regardless of the population, financial differences, or geographic limitations of school districts.

The governing unit consists of an elected board of 9 members. Members are elected for four-year terms from nine distinct election districts. Meetings are conducted at 7:00 p.m. on the third Monday of each month.

Educational Service Unit 10 utilizes an advisory committee structure for the purpose of receiving feedback and developing recommendations for services that are provided to schools. Local school administrators and county superintendents are elected by their peers to serve on the Administrator Advisory Committee, which meets at least four times during the year. The recommendations of the committee are considered by the school districts in the ESU 10 area. Once two-thirds of the school districts that contain at least one-half of the student population approve the administrator advisory committee recommendations, the Board of Directors makes the final decisions concerning the program of services for the unit.</p>

Educational Service Unit 10 employs 93 staff members who provide services to students in the counties of Blaine, Buffalo, Custer, Dawson, Garfield, Greeley, Hall, Howard, Loup, Sherman, and Valley.  Included in these counties are 34 K-12 districts, 4 residential schools and 11 parochial schools.  The area served covers approximately 9,325 square miles and includes an estimated 29,600 students in grades K-12.

                            <p>The Sunday Science School is a registered institute for advancing the concept of learning by Doing. In a more apt way, it is an institute that facilitates Experiential learning, mainly for young brains! SSS is launched by people who are active in the field of Science Activities for students for more than 20 years.

In 2008, SSS programme was launched at Ahmednagar, Maharashtra. On successful completion of 3 years, the programme was replicated at more than 75 locations in Maharashtra , Karnataka, Kerala, Tamilnadu, Andhra Pradesh, Goa, Madhya Pradesh, Gujrat, Rajsthan, Uttar Pradesh and Delhi NCR. Based on the rich experience of science activities and manufacturing and designing of science kits for over 20 years.

SSS has developed a Hands-on science syllabus which is mapped with CBSE curriculum.

 With strong conviction that Doing science is not just beneficial, but absolute necessary to know science in its spirits. 

 SSS believes showing science experiments by teachers or using modern tools like virtual labs and e-learning software is not adequate to develop habit of experimentation or gain confidence of doing things by hands. 

 The goal of SSS’s new education system should be to create entrepreneurs, innovators, artists, scientists and thinkers who can establish the foundation of a knowledge based economy.

 Sunday Science School has focused its efforts on school children ,if groomed at proper age, children will become an asset to the nation. 

 SSS emphasizes on experiential science learning. This develops many qualities in children like curiosity, observation skills, analytical approach, problem solving skills, scientific temperament, creativity, patience etc.  </p>
